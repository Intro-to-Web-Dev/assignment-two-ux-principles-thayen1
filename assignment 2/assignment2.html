                <p>Hello Christ. I hope you are having a wonderful day when you 
                    are grading this. So I want to start by saying that I wasn't 
                    sure if we were supposed to have created the site map and 
                    wireframing in visual studio code or if we can create them 
                    in Illustrator or somewhere else and then bring them into 
                    our code. The reason I'm asking this is that I created both 
                    of my things in Illustrator. Hopefully, that's okay.
                    </p>

                    <p>So I chose to have 4 Persistent navigation pages instead of the
                        previous 3 that I may have mention. Mainly because I broke the
                        Personal Cards and Business Cards into two separate pages. I'm
                        not really sure if I'm going to keep them as separate pages, so
                        they might end up together. For my individual pages underneath,
                        I have 9 of them, but I think they're fairly easy as all I'm
                        doing is explaining what they are and do. I may be pushing it
                        but I think I'll be able to do it.
                        </p>
